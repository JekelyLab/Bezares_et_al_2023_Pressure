## How to work with the data

This resource has been developed using the statistical programming
language R. To work with the data and code, you will need installed on
your computer the [R software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and
optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

If you would like to use the project, you could open Rstudio in your
computer, then go to File \> New Project \> Version Control \> Git.
Under repository URL add the URL of this page and save it in a local
folder.

The R project will live in the folder (as working directory) where the
.Rproj file is saved. All other files and directories will be accessed
relative to this working directory. This way the project is portable and
self-contained.

The working directory contains this README file, a LICENCE file, a
CITATION.cff file, the .gitignore file and the R project file. You can
update these files to fit your project.

Data/TablesResults contains all metric table data that are the output of
the behavioural tracking videos.

Code/Figures contains all the R code to generate all the figures in the
paper.

Manuscript/Manuscript/pressuresensationPlankton.qmd is the Quarto
markdown file with the text of the paper.
Manuscript/bibliography_pressurepaper.bib contains the references.
